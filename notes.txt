For David:

  - I added error messages for in the review create dialog on the last step.
    Take a look to see if you want to add css?
  - Administrate Questionnaires should float right
  - Admin checkbox on a person
  - Columns on my reviews and dashboard not equally spaced
  - Logout link

=== questions ===

  - it can be awkward when you set up a review for someone else to administrate.  You have
    only one chance to add reviewers: right after it's created.  Then you can never access it
    again because you're not administrating it.
